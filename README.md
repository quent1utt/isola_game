# isola_game

## Introduction
The objective of this mini-project is to produce a VB program to play the ISOLA game, verifying that the player complies with the rules of the game.

## Game Rules and Description

Isola is a strategy game for two players. It is played on a rectangular board of size Number of row * Number of column with Nl = Nc. Each player has one pawn. At the beginning of the game, the two pawns are located in the middle of the opposite sides. If Nl is even, the two pieces are diagonal. For example on version 1, Nl = 6 and Nc = 8. One of the pieces will be located in (4,1) and the other in (3,8).

In each turn, each player:
- Moves the pawn to a free square adjacent to or touching the starting square by a corner.
- Destroys an unoccupied game box, it is destroyed for the rest of the game.

The first player who can no longer move his pawn, that is to say, who is on a square that no longer touches any free square either by a side or a corner, loses the game. The goal of the game is therefore to block your opponent and not to be trapped.
